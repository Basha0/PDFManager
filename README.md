# pdfmanager

For now only tested on Android. For iOS is have to change the storage handling.


# Why i created this project

For my own use. I read some stuff mostly dowloaded from the internet, and i dont like the avaible PDF managers as they doesn't have feature i like to have while reading the PDF's. I want to have something like a libarary as a App, where i can create "Books" with cover and a Custom description. Also being able to add maybe something like "chapters" to the "Books". Those "Chapters" are PDF's downloaded from the internet, where as i can give them a custom name. Also i want to persist the last page for each chapter where I stopped reading so can continue next time.
